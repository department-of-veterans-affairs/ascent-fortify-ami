# Fortify AWS Module

This repo contains a Module for how to deploy Fortify utility servers on AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Fortify is s licensed distribution that performs security scans on your code. By default, Fortify SSC uses a MySQL database as the storage backend for scans, suppressions, etc.

This Module includes:
- **fortify-server**: This module sets up and performs the initial configuration of a [Fortify SSC](https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/products/software-security-assurance-sdlc/overview) V17.20 EC2 instance, MySQL database, security groups, etc. Fortify SSC's functionality is described by the [HP Fortify SSC Install and Config Guide](https://community.softwaregrp.com/dcvta86296/attachments/dcvta86296/software-security-center-v440/2/1/HP_Fortify_SSC_%20Install_and_Config_Guide_4.40.pdf) in the following way: "Software Security Center family of products performs sophisticated analysis of an enterpriseâ€™s source code that results in concise summaries of source code security vulnerabilities."
- **fortify-security-group-rules**: This module contains all of the security group rules needed for Fortify SSC and its database.
- **fortify-database**: This module is the database dedicated to storing Fortify SSC's data. It is an [AWS RDS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) with a [MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html) database engine.
- **rds-security-group-rules**: This module contains the security group rules necessary for the fortify SSC instance to successfully connect to the RDS database instance.
- **fortify-db-parameter-groups**: This module contains all of the database settings necessary for Fortify SSC to connect to the MySQL database engine as described in the [Fortify SSC Installation Guide](https://community.softwaregrp.com/dcvta86296/attachments/dcvta86296/software-security-center-v440/2/1/HP_Fortify_SSC_%20Install_and_Config_Guide_4.40.pdf)
- **s3-bucket-policies-to-role**: As Fortify is a paid distribution, it is necessary to download any software and licensing from an [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-configure-bucket.html) to the EC2 instance on which Fortify SSC is hosted. The EC2 Instance, then, should be created with a [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) attached to it with the S3 bucket policies as defined by this module.
- **jenkins-fortify-slave**: This module creates and configures an EC2 Instance to run as a jenkins slave performing source scans using various Fortify tools such as sourceanalyzer and FPRUtility.
- **jenkins-node-security-group-rules**: The security group rules needed for the jenkins fortify slave instance to route to the Jenkins Master instance.

## What's a Module?
Modules in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. Modules are used to create reusable components in Terraform as well as for basic code organization. A **root module** is the current working directory when you run `terraform apply` or get, holding the Terraform configuration files. It is itself a valid module. The root modules in this project are **fortify-server** and **jenkins-fortify-slave**. See [https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html] for more details for creating your own module.

## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html)
- An active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
- A valid Fortify license and Fortify software uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket
  * **Bucket Name**: ascent-Fortify
  * **Software Key**: HPE_Security_Fortify_17.20_Server_WAR_Tomcat.zip
  * **SCA and Utilities Key**: HPE_Security_Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_17.20_Linux.tar.gz
  * **License Key**: fortify.license
  * **Region**: us-gov-west-1

  *(TODO: Need to make all of these parameterized and filled in via template rendering in terraform)*
- [A Jenkins Master server](https://jenkins.io/download/)


## How do you use this Module?
This Module has the following folder structure:
- [modules](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/modules): This folder contains the reusable code for this Module, broken down into one or more modules.
- [packer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/packer): This folder contains all of the scripts necessary to create an [AWS AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) that has the capabilities to create a Fortify SSC server or a Fortify Jenkins Slave.

##### To Deploy Fortify SSC 17.20
1. Create an AMI that has Fortify SSC installed (using the [packer scripts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/packer))
2. Deploy that AMI in a private subnet with a MySQL AWS RDS instance using the Terraform [fortify-server](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/modules/fortify-server) module.
3. Log into the SSC server.
  * If you have the ascent dns servers deployed already, you can wait until the next day and log into the Fortify SSC server URL at http://fortify.internal.vets-api.gov:8080/ssc
  * If you **do not have** the ascent dns servers deployed or don't have the patience to wait for the next day, then log into the Fortify SSC server through http://{fortify_private_ip}:8080/ssc
  * The first time username/password credentials are admin/admin. You will be prompted to change them after logging in.

##### To Deploy Fortify Jenkins Slave
1. Create an AMI that has Fortify SCA and Apps installed (using the [packer scripts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/packer))
2. Setup your Jenkins Master for the slave to connect to
3. Deploy your AMI from Step 1 in a private subnet and register it to the Jenkins Master instance using the Terraform [jenkins-fortify-slave](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ascent-fortify-ami/tree/master/modules/jenkins-fortify-slave) module.
